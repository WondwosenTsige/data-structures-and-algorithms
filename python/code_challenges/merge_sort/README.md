# Code challenge 27

## Assignment

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Pseudocode

```py
ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n <-- arr.length

    if n > 1
      DECLARE mid <-- n/2
      DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
      DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
      // sort the left side
      Mergesort(left)
      // sort the right side
      Mergesort(right)
      // merge the sorted left and right sides together
      Merge(left, right, arr)

ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i <-- 0
    DECLARE j <-- 0
    DECLARE k <-- 0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            arr[k] <-- left[i]
            i <-- i + 1
        else
            arr[k] <-- right[j]
            j <-- j + 1

        k <-- k + 1

    if i = left.length
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left
```

Sample Arrays

In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]

Implementation

Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
Present a complete set of working tests

Requirements

Write unit tests
Follow the template for a well-formatted README
