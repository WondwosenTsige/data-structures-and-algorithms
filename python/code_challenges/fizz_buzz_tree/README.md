# Code challemge 18 (fizz buzz tree)

## Challenge description

Feature Tasks

    Write a function called fizz buzz tree
    Arguments: k-ary tree
    Return: new k-ary tree

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

    If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

    If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

    If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

    If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Unit Tests Required

can sucessfuly test a pair of matching opening and closing brackets

can sucessfuly test a pair of unmatching opening and closing brackets

can sucessfuly test multiple matching opening and closing brackets with strings

can sucessfuly test a pair of unmatching opening and closing brackets with one extra unmatching opening or closing bracket

can sucessfuly test multiple matching opening and closing brackets but order is not balanced

## approach and efficiency

## Resources and Collaboration

I get the overall Idea and the code from the following weblink, understand it well and wrote all the test cases from scratch by myself
