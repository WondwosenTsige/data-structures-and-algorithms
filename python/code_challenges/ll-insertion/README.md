## Linked list insertions: lab-06

### Challenge description

Extend the LinkedList class to allow various insertion methods:

- .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.

- .nsertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

- .nsertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### Unit Tests Required

1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list

2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list

3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list

4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list

5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list

6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
