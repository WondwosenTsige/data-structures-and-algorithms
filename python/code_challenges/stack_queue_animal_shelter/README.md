# Code challemge 12 (stack and queue animal shelter)

## Challenge description

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.

The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

Implement the following methods:

    enqueue
        Arguments: animal
                animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
    dequeue
        Arguments: pref
                pref can be either "dog" or "cat"

        Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
                If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Unit Tests Required

can succefully enqueue an animal

can succesfully dequeue an animal

enqueeing an other than dog and cat animal will raise exception

dequeueing an unavailable animal will raise exception

## approach and efficiency

I used the basic concept of importing a node and queue from my previous code challenges stack-and-queue as I did in stack-queue-pseudo(code challange 11)

## Resources and Collaboration

I get help on fixing my test case from my Teaching Assistant, Aliya Summers. Thank you!
