## Unit Tests Required

can sucessfuly test a pair of matching opening and closing brackets

can sucessfuly test a pair of unmatching opening and closing brackets

can sucessfuly test multiple matching opening and closing brackets with strings

can sucessfuly test a pair of unmatching opening and closing brackets with one extra unmatching opening or closing bracket

can sucessfuly test multiple matching opening and closing brackets but order is not balanced

## approach and efficiency

## Resources and Collaboration

I get the overall Idea and the code from the following weblink, understand it well and wrote all the test cases from scratch by myself
