# Code challemge 15 Trees

## Challenge description

Create a Binary Tree class

    Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
        pre order
        in order
        post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

Create a Binary Search Tree class

    This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

    Add
        Arguments: value
        Return: nothing
        Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

    Contains
        Argument: value
        Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
