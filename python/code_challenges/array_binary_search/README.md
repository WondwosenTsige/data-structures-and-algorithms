# Array Binary Search

## Challenge

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## approach and efficiency

We choose getting the middle index of the list and compare it with the search key so that we can know which hlaf orf the array we need to search.
